As for display managers you have two options:

* Using GDM with the Mojave shell theme
* Using LightDM with the WebKit2 greeter

If you choose the latter one, I recommend using the Glorious theme since it looks the closest to the macOS login screen.
Download link: https://github.com/manilarome/lightdm-webkit2-theme-glorious
AUR package:   lightdm-webkit2-theme-glorious

After installing the Glorious theme, with your preferred text editor open /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and change the following line:

102 | greeter-session=(whatever greeter)

to:

102 | greeter-session=lightdm-webkit2-greeter

If it's commented, remove the # at the beginning of it.

Now we're gonna edit the file /etc/lightdm/lightdm-webkit2-greeter.conf ; if it doesn't exist, create it. Now edit the following line as follows:

21 | webkit_theme = default

to:

21 | webkit_theme = glorious

Once you reboot and go into the Glorious greeter, you can change your wallpaper from there.
